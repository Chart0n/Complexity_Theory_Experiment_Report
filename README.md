# Complexity_Theory_Report
The project contains literature review and python experiments on complexity theory arithmetics. 
* The main topic is **Complexity Theory**, each member could choose at least one subtopic from below or from other resources.
* Group works should meet and merge on dead Line: **2024.04.15 00:00**
* The final assessment is supposed to be submitted on **2024.4.22 00:00** (this is for general estimating, please refer to the final deadline on moodle).
* **Requirments and Tasks:**  

  1. The report is supposed to be two section mainly: `Theoretical part` and `Experimental part`

      1. **Experimental part (This is a optional part could be submitted)**

          * It is not mandatory.
          * If there is or are experiment or experiments, should better be based on **python**.
          * It should related to the subtopic you choose.
          * There should be findings, discussions and conclusions of the experiment or the experiments.
      2. **Theoretical part (This is the mandatory part should be submitted)**

          * It is mandatory.
          * It should related to the subtopic you choose.
          * There should be at least introduction and literature review.
* **Subtopics for experiments** including but not limited to:

  * Sorting Algorithms
  * Efficiency of Search Algorithm
  * Efficiency of Recursive Algorithms
  * Graph Algorithms
  * Dynamic Programming Algorithms
  * Hashing Algorithms
  * Parallel Algorithm
  * Partitioning Algorithms
